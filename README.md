# Habitable-Zone-Analysis
This repository contains Python code for calculating and analyzing the habitable zone (HZ) of the M-dwarf star Proxima Centauri. The analysis includes determining the inner and outer boundaries of the HZ using empirical formulas from Kopparapu et al. (2014), and comparing Proxima Centauri's HZ to that of the Solar System.
